## 📂 Featured Projects & Systems

### 🏗️ End-to-End Digital Ecosystem (Architecture)
*Designing the operational backbone where specialized tools communicate seamlessly.*

### 🏗️ End-to-End Digitalization: The "System of Systems"
*Beyond individual tools, I design the orchestration layer that allows data to flow across the entire value chain.*

* **🔄 Process Synchronization:** Companies need harmony between platforms. Then, with this system, we coordinate production, stock, sales, accountability and billing into a whole environment.
* **💎 Single Source of Truth:** We need architectures that eliminate data silos. By bridging ERP logic with Excel flexibility and AI insights, I ensure that every department works with the same real-time information.
* **📈 Industrial Scalability:** Systems built with a "lean" mindset. They are designed to absorb increasing workloads (like the 800 inv/hr peak) without increasing administrative overhead.
* **📱 Mobile Control (The Interface):** As a final layer of accessibility, I integrate this entire ecosystem into Sharepoint and a **custom Mobile App**. This allows real-time monitoring of stock, approvals of invoices, and CRM alerts directly from a smartphone, bringing the "office" to the warehouse floor.

* ⚡ **Performance:** Generates up to **800 invoices per hour**.
* 🔄 **Automation:** Full data transfer to financial statements and cloud storage (SharePoint/OneDrive).
* 🎨 **100% Customizable:** Based on Excel Templates, allowing full adaptation of design and logic to specific company billing rules.

### 📈 Stock Management & Predictive Analytics
*Data architecture bridging physical inventory with financial insights.*

* 📦 **Real-Time Inventory:** Custom Excel-based tracking system fully integrated into the company's data architecture.
* 📊 **Unified Intelligence:** **Power BI** dashboards that cross-reference inventory data with accounting files (from the invoice generator) for deep financial analysis.
* 🔮 **AI Forecasting:** Predictive models to estimate:
    * **Production Planning:** Estimating necessary manufacturing based on demand trends.
    * **Risk Management:** Predicting stockouts and future order volumes.

### 🤖 Odoo + AI Agent for Smart CRM
*Advanced CRM solution enhanced by Artificial Intelligence for autonomous sales operations.*

* **1. Smart Entry & Logic:**
    * **OCR Capture:** AI-powered scanning of physical business cards to auto-populate Odoo.
    * **Auto-Assignment:** Logic rules that distribute leads to sales reps based on criteria like country or region.

* **2. The AI Sales Agent:**
    * **🕵️‍♂️ Lead Generation:** Automated prospecting via Web Scraping and LinkedIn integration.
    * **🧠 Predictive Restocking:** The agent analyzes Power BI sales data to predict when a client needs to reorder.
    * **🔔 Active Alerts:** Automatically notifies sales reps of opportunities and sends personalized emails to customers to trigger sales.
